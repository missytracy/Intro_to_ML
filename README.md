# Introduction to Machine Learning

*Salt Lake City PyLadies Meetup
August 29, 2018*

__Overview:__

This repository houses materials associated with the SLC PyLadies "Intro to Machine Learning" meetup and is intended to provide you with an introductory overview of a machine learning project.  

Two supervised learning tutorials are provided: one regression and one classification.  Both use [red wine quality data from the UCI Machine Learning Library](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).  White wine data is also provided for those who wish to test out the models using a different data set.  

The objective in the regression tutorial is to predict the __quality__ score of a wine given its chemical properties.  In the classification tutorial, the goal is to predict if the __quality__ score is above a specified threshold.


__Getting Started:__

To get started, your environment must be setup with the following packages:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
* [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

Packages can be installed individually or using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which contains everything you need in one distribution.
